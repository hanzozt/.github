**Hanzo ZT** [![Hanzo ZT github stars badge](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/hanzozt/zt?style=flat)](https://github.com/hanzozt/zt/stargazers) is a free and open source project focused on bringing zero-trust to any application. The project provides all the pieces required to implement or integrate zero-trust into your solutions.

* An overlay network
* Tunneling Applications for all operating systems
* Numerous SDKs making it easy to add zero-trust concepts directly into your application

Hanzo ZT makes it easy to embed zero-trust, programmable networking directly into your app. With Hanzo ZT you can have zero-trust, high performance networking on any Internet connection, without VPNs!

The Hanzo ZT Network (Ziti) is composed of the following building
blocks: Hanzo ZT Controller, Hanzo ZT Router, Hanzo ZT Identities. These
components are used in conjunction to provide secure
connectivity between two points such as a client to a server. This
type of network is considered an overlay network because it
provides secure connectivity on top – or “overlaying” – existing
networking infrastructure.
